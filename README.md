CivicDataLab will support a more equitable distribution of public goods, services, and works procured for flood relief in the State of Assam. It will build data-driven tools that will enable public officials to make smarter, data-informed decisions about public spending. This project will be implemented in collaboration with members of the Government of Assam, including the Finance Department.
